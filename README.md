# SQL-Relational-Design-Portfolio-: DB Assignment 02 

📌 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of relational database designs and SQL solutions developed during the Spring 2026 semester at FAST School of Computing, NUCES Lahore. The project demonstrates proficiency in schema modeling, relational algebra, and complex data retrieval across three distinct domains. 

📁 Repository Structure
The project is divided into three core questions, each targeting specific RDBMS concepts:

1. Fast & Furious Racing League 🏎️
Focus: Many-to-Many relationships and performance analytics.
 Key Features:
- Driver reward systems and car customization tracking.
- Querying the fastest driver per race and ranking drivers by total prize money.
- Analyzing car brand diversity and upgrade frequency.

2. PowerPuffDB: The Battle Records
Focus: Self-referencing joins, data integrity, and weighted scoring.
Key Features:
- Bloodline Preservation: Managing family ties (siblings/parents) through self-joins in the FamilyRelation table.
- Strength Scoring: Calculating power levels using a weighted formula: (Powers x Rank) + Battles.
- Combat History: Identifying undefeated creatures and tracking the most frequent battle opponents.

3. SPJ: Suppliers-Parts-Jobs-Logistics
Focus: Central Hub (Junction) architecture and supply chain logic
Key Features:
- The Hub Model: A three-way junction table (Shipments) connecting Suppliers, Parts, and Jobs.
- Relational Division: Finding parts shipped by more than one supplier or those never shipped to any job.
- Set Operations: Identifying geographical overlaps where both a supplier and a job are located in the same city.

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
-DDL & DML: Creating normalized schemas with primary/foreign key constraints and complex data insertion
- Advanced Joins: Implementation of INNER, LEFT, and SELF JOINS to navigate multi-table schemas.
- Aggregate Logic: Utilizing COUNT, SUM, AVG, and HAVING clauses for business intelligence reporting.
- Subqueries & CTEs: Handling nested logic for ranking and filtering across complex datasets.
